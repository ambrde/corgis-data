/make a data by year page?
	earliest year any turbines were built = 1983
	user selects a year, shows total number of turbines built that year, maybe their location? or total capacity?

/add context for how much power x amount of megawatts is ("x megawatts could power y homes for z years!" or something similar
	****https://greenportfolio.com/blog/megawatt-solar-energy-wind-power/ **** use this source!
		assuming low avergae wind speeds, one MW of wind energy would produce ~1450 MWh 
			powers 187 homes for a year!
			1 MW = 187 homes -> x MW =  187x homes
			
			average home consumes about 10.65 MWh per year (greenportfolio source and linked https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3)
			if one MW would produce ~1450MWh, that is only 136 homes powered, not 187?
				-changed factor to 136 for now

add when the first and/or most recent turbines were built for the selected state,
	**or add a fun wind-energy-related fact about the chosen state?**
		
/add a button to the home page that takes the user to the form page 

style

add full state names-- downloaded json file already (state_abbrs.json), wrote some code but not sure if its useful:
	with open("state_abbrs.json") as state_abbrs:
        stnames = json.load(state_abbrs)
